# Sentiment-Analysis
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of movie reviews, where the goal is to automatically classify reviews as either positive or negative using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The dataset consists of thousands of movie reviews that are first preprocessed through text cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization to ensure high-quality input. For feature extraction, the project uses TF-IDF vectorization, which effectively represents the text data in numerical form suitable for ML models. Several machine learning algorithms are implemented and compared, including Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes, which are well-suited for text classification tasks. Model performance is evaluated using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring that the models are not only accurate but also balanced in predicting both positive and negative classes. Visualizations are included to provide insights into model evaluation and review distribution. The project is implemented in Python using libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib, making it reproducible and easy to extend. This work demonstrates how sentiment analysis can be applied to understand audience opinions, improve recommendation systems, and monitor feedback on movies or other products. In real-world applications, the same pipeline can be scaled to analyze social media posts, customer reviews, or any text data where public sentiment plays a critical role. Overall, this project serves as a practical example of combining NLP and machine learning to extract insights from unstructured text data, while also highlighting the importance of preprocessing, feature engineering, and proper evaluation in building effective sentiment classification systems.
